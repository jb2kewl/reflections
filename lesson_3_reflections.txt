Creating new File on GitHub
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Pretty much always for backup purposes.
  When you want to collaborate with others.
  When you want to share you code with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because you might be collaborating with someone and do not want their changes in your project.
